	### How to contribute ? 
 
     Step 1: Set up a working copy on your computer

     This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you’ll see a note that it’s
     been forked underneath the project name:
     Now you need a copy locally, so find the “SSH clone URL” in the right hand column and use Which will do 
     something like this:
     
     •	$ git clone https://github.com/FOSSCODY-1/S.T.S.Muthumala.git
    
     Change into the new project’s directory:
     
     •	$ cd S.T.S.Muthumala
    
    Then go to your folder and see the files that you had cloned. 
      
     Step 2 : Now you can open and edit this project and save it in this folder. 
      
     Step 3 : Now you have to push the repositories in to the Github. Open the terminal and type this.
   
     •	$ git commit –m “Write Your Message here” 
 
     •	$ git push origin master
   
     
     Now you are contribute the project and all done.
    
     
     Step 4 : Exit the terminal to type this
     •	$ exit
